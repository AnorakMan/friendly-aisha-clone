There are three different types of rock: Igneous, Sedimentary and Metamorphic.
Geology is the study of the rocks.
The seafloor is formed of a dark lava called basalt.
Some granite, in Australia, is believed to be more than four billion years old.
Sandstone is formed from sand, mudstone from mud, and limestone from seashells, diatoms, or bonelike minerals precipitating out of calcium-rich water.
Metamorphic rocks are sedimentary or igneous rocks that have been transformed by pressure, heat, or the intrusion of fluids.
Marble is metamorphosed limestone, quartzite is metamorphosed sandstone, and gneiss, another common metamorphic rock, sometimes begins as granite.
A rock is a naturally occuring solid.
The powder of a mineral rock called cinnabar makes a brilliant red colour that was widely used in art in the Middle Ages.
Gemstones are minerals valued by humans for their beauty, rarity, and durability. The most valuable include diamonds, emeralds, rubies, and sapphires.
